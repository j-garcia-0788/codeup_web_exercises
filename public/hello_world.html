		<h1><center>Hello from CodeUp!</center></h1>

		<p><center>My name is James!<br> I'm currently enrolled in Codeup and <em>love</em> working with HTML!<strong><br>HTML is so much better than PHP!</strong> But I'll manage PHP eventually. <br>I can't wait to finish Codeup and hopefully find a job in the IT world. One day it will happen.<br>I love the urban lifestyle and I hope to eventually move downtown into one of the many apartments currently under construction or planned in the core.<p>

		<h2><center>My favorite quote<center></h2>
		<blockquote><em>Do or do not. There is no try.</em> -Yoda</blockquote>
		<p> I relate to this dog on a spritual level<br>
